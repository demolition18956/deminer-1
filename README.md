# Senior Design Demining Project
This code base will change significantly on Saturday, Feb 1st.

## Contributing
I'll probably just give everyone write access and let you push to your own branches.   
Then I can merge code when you're ready. That way we don't have to deal with people not understanding Pull Requests or someone overwriting master.  
* Clone the repo
```bash
cd <some directory>
git clone https://github.com/notgate/deminer
cd deminer
git branch <your branch name>
git checkout <your branch name>
```
* Committing changes
```bash
git add . # or add the specific file you changed
git commit -m "Talk about the change you made"
git push origin <your branch>
```
